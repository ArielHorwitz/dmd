I use KMonad, btw.

## What is this?
A collection of stuff that allows me to use a GUI in [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) *without a mouse* thanks mostly to [KMonad](https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad), as well as other customizations.

## Should I use this?
Probably not. Even if you do want to *permanently disconnect your mouse*, this project contains quite a bit of hand-crafted software with customizations baked-in. This repo doubles as my over-glorified (and sometimes over-engineered) dotfiles.

While I am working towards moving all customizations to separate configuration files, it will be a very long and involved process. This is not a high priority at the moment.

## If I insist, can I join the project?
Absolutely! [Hit me up](https://ariel.ninja).
