Personal configurations and dotfiles, managed by [homux](https://github.com/ArielHorwitz/homux), and a suite of utilities and scripts that help me live mostly in the terminal and disconnect the mouse permanently. I use arch, btw.

> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as my workstation, is in fact, Linux/KMonad, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, Linux plus KMonad. An operating system is not complete unto itself, but rather the foundation of a mouseless system made possible by KMonad, shell utilities and vital system components comprising an efficient and streamlined workstation operated via the keyboard. Many computer users run a lame system, without realizing it.

Many apps are actually GUIs, and these people are using them, while the editor alone is just one part of the system they use.
